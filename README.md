This app should show books and be displayed like books on a shelf.
The user can hover the book to see more info about it.
The user should be able to sort the books based on alphabet, or year.**
The user should be able to add a book to the library.**
The user should be able to 'check' a book out of the library and add it to their collection (click).
The user should be able to filter books by typing the name.**

Notes:

- my Books hover reveals details for all books instead on individual one being hovered...
- when user clicks on book, whether in collection or my Books, the book is added to opposite 'page' but not immediately deleted. On refresh the delete is shown. 
- figure out how to show the top 3 liked books on Home
